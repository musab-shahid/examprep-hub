  keyFacts: [
    "Distance is the total path length travelled; it is a scalar with SI unit metre (m).",
    "Displacement is the straight-line change in position from start to finish, including direction; it is a vector with SI unit metre (m).",

    "Velocity = displacement / time, a vector with SI unit m/s.",
    "Acceleration = change in velocity / time interval, a vector with SI unit m/s².",
    "On a distance-time graph, slope = speed; on a velocity-time graph, slope = acceleration and area under graph = displacement.",

  explanationSections: [
    { heading: "Scalar vs vector quantities", body: "Distance and speed carry only magnitude. Displacement and velocity carry magnitude and direction. A runner completing one 400 m lap has travelled 400 m distance but has zero displacement, because the finish coincides with the start. Two cars may have the same speed but opposite velocities if they move in opposite directions." },
    { heading: "Reading motion graphs", body: "A steeper slope on a distance-time graph means a higher speed; a horizontal line means the object is stationary. On a velocity-time graph, a horizontal line means constant velocity (zero acceleration), an upward slope means speeding up in the positive direction, and the signed area between the line and the time axis gives displacement." },
    { heading: "Sign conventions for acceleration", body: "Acceleration is positive when velocity increases in the chosen positive direction and negative when velocity decreases in that direction. A ball thrown upward has negative acceleration (g downward) throughout its flight, even at the instant it is momentarily at rest at the top." },

    title: "Vector Applications: Force, Velocity, Wind & Wave Components",
    definition: "Vector components are used to analyse forces, velocities and other directed quantities in two or three dimensions. This is essential for problems involving inclined planes, projectiles, wind components and wave forces.",
    keyFacts: [
      "On an inclined plane, weight has components mg sin θ parallel to the plane and mg cos θ perpendicular to the plane.",
      "Projectile motion is analysed separately in horizontal (constant velocity) and vertical (constant acceleration g) components.",
      "Wind velocity can be resolved into components along chosen axes.",
      "The resultant of several forces gives the net force that determines acceleration via F = ma.",
      "Vector diagrams are powerful tools for solving equilibrium problems.",
      "Lami's theorem can be used for three forces in equilibrium."
    ],
    explanationSections: [
      { heading: "Inclined planes", body: "A block on a slope is pulled downward by a component of its weight along the slope: mg sin θ. The normal force from the slope balances the perpendicular component mg cos θ. Friction, if present, acts up the slope opposing motion." },
      { heading: "Projectile motion", body: "The horizontal motion of a projectile has constant velocity (ignoring air resistance), while the vertical motion has constant downward acceleration g. The two motions are independent. The time of flight depends only on vertical motion." },
      { heading: "Wind and current problems", body: "A plane's velocity relative to the ground is the vector sum of its velocity relative to the air and the wind velocity. Similarly, a boat's velocity relative to the shore is the vector sum of its velocity in still water and the current velocity." },
      { heading: "Equilibrium", body: "When the vector sum of all forces on an object is zero, the object is in equilibrium. Draw the force polygon; if it closes, the forces balance. This is used for suspended signs, towed objects and structural problems." }
    ],
    workedExample: [
      {
        problem: "A 10 kg block rests on a smooth slope inclined at 30° to the horizontal. Find the component of its weight (a) down the slope and (b) perpendicular to the slope.",
        solution: "Weight W = mg = 10 × 9.8 = 98 N. Component down slope = W sin 30° = 98 × 0.50 = 49 N. Component perpendicular = W cos 30° = 98 × 0.866 ≈ 84.9 N.",
        answer: "49 N down the slope; 84.9 N perpendicular into the slope."
      },
      {
        problem: "An aircraft can fly at 200 m/s in still air. It heads due north but a wind of 50 m/s blows from west to east. Find the aircraft's resultant velocity.",
        solution: "The wind adds an eastward component of 50 m/s. Resultant speed = √(200² + 50²) = √(40 000 + 2 500) = √42 500 ≈ 206 m/s. Direction θ = tan⁻¹(50/200) ≈ 14° east of north.",
        answer: "≈ 206 m/s at 14° east of north."

      "Treating horizontal and vertical projectile motions as connected by time but forgetting they share the same time of flight.",

      "Drawing the normal force perpendicular to the surface but then using mg for it."
    ],
    examPoints: [
      "On a slope: parallel component = mg sin θ; perpendicular component = mg cos θ.",
      "Projectile range is maximum at 45° for a given launch speed (ignoring air resistance).",
      "Resultant velocity is found by vector addition of all velocity contributions.",
      "For equilibrium, the vector sum of forces and the vector sum of torques must both be zero."
