  question: "The Magnetic North Pole of Earth is, in physics terms, actually a magnetic SOUTH pole.",
  options: ["True", "False"],
  correctAnswer: 0,
  explanation: "True. By convention, the 'Magnetic North Pole' is the point where the field points vertically downward, which means it attracts the north-seeking end of a compass needle. Since opposite poles attract, this point is in physics terms a magnetic south pole.",

  options: ["High pressure alone", "A small percentage of partial melt (~1–5%) that allows mineral grains to slide past each other", "The presence of liquid water in pore spaces", "Tidal stresses from the Moon"],
  correctAnswer: 1,
  explanation: "A small fraction of partial melt (a few percent) coats mineral grains at asthenospheric depths, allowing them to slide past each other under stress and producing plastic flow over geological time. This is also why S-waves slow down in the asthenosphere (the 'low-velocity zone').",

  correctAnswer: 1,
  explanation: "Two effects combine: (1) the centrifugal acceleration from rotation is maximum at the equator, partly offsetting gravity; (2) the equator is ~21 km farther from Earth's centre, weakening gravity by the inverse-square law. Together these lower equatorial g by about 0.5% relative to polar g.",

  question: "Match the seismic wave with its characteristic: (1) P-wave (2) S-wave (3) Love wave (4) Rayleigh wave — which pairing is correct?",
  options: [
    "1=shear only, 2=compressional, 3=rolling surface, 4=horizontal surface",
    "1=compressional (solids+liquids), 2=shear (solids only), 3=horizontal surface shear, 4=rolling elliptical surface",
    "1=surface only, 2=body only, 3=P-wave shadow, 4=S-wave shadow",
    "1=slowest, 2=fastest, 3=Love, 4=Rayleigh"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 1,
  explanation: "P-waves are compressional and travel through solids and liquids; S-waves are shear and travel only through solids; Love waves are horizontal surface shear; Rayleigh waves produce rolling elliptical motion at the surface.",

{ id: "EARTH-A3-Q010", sectionId: "EARTH-A", topicId: "earth-a3", difficulty: "hard", type: "single",
  question: "Assertion (A): S-waves do not pass through the outer core. Reason (R): The outer core is liquid and cannot support shear stress. Choose the correct option:",
  options: [
    "Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A",
    "Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A",
    "A is true but R is false",
    "A is false but R is true"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 0,
  explanation: "Both statements are true and R correctly explains A. S-waves require a solid medium that can support shear; liquids cannot, so the S-wave shadow zone is direct evidence that the outer core is liquid.",

{ id: "EARTH-D3-Q010", sectionId: "EARTH-D", topicId: "earth-d3", difficulty: "hard", type: "single",
  question: "Assertion (A): Continent–continent collisions produce high fold mountains but little volcanism. Reason (R): Both plates are buoyant continental lithosphere that cannot readily subduct to the depths required for flux melting. Choose the correct option:",
  options: [
    "Both A and R are true and R is the correct explanation of A",
    "Both A and R are true but R is not the correct explanation of A",
    "A is true but R is false",
    "A is false but R is true"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 0,
  explanation: "Both A and R are true; R is the correct explanation. Without deep subduction of oceanic lithosphere there is no significant release of volatiles to trigger melting of the mantle wedge, hence minimal volcanism (Himalayas, Alps).",

{ id: "EARTH-I2-Q007", sectionId: "EARTH-I", topicId: "earth-i2", difficulty: "medium", type: "single",
  question: "Which statement about the 2005 Kashmir (Muzaffarabad) earthquake is correct?",
  options: [
    "It was M8.1 and generated a major tsunami",
    "It was M7.6, killed approximately 87,000+ people, and led to major reforms in disaster management and building codes in Pakistan",
    "It occurred on the Makran Subduction Zone",
    "It was the largest earthquake ever recorded in Pakistan"
  ],
  correctAnswer: 1,
  explanation: "The 2005 Kashmir earthquake was Mw 7.6, killed ~87,000+ (mostly in Pakistan), and prompted creation of the NDMA and stricter building-code enforcement. The 1945 Makran event was larger (M8.1) and generated a tsunami; the 1935 Quetta event was also highly destructive.",
