  title: 'Arithmetic Foundations: Numbers, Fractions, Decimals & Percentages',

  definition:
    'Arithmetic is the foundation of every HAT quantitative question. This chapter builds the core number sense you need: understanding what numbers mean, working fluently with fractions, decimals and percentages, applying ratios and proportions correctly, and recognising which arithmetic technique each question demands. Most HAT errors are not caused by difficult mathematics — they are caused by weak arithmetic setup. Master this chapter and roughly half the quantitative section becomes manageable. The chapter is organised so that each subtopic builds on the previous one: number sense → fractions & decimals → percentages → ratios & proportions → method selection.',

      title: 'Understanding Numbers and Number Types',
      summary: 'Recognising integers, fractions, decimals, ratios and percentages as different ways of expressing the same underlying quantity.',
      explanation:
        'Numbers describe quantities. The same quantity can be written in many forms. The fraction 3/4, the decimal 0.75 and the percentage 75% all describe exactly the same relationship: three-quarters of something. The skill is to convert fluently between these forms and to choose whichever is most convenient for the question in front of you.\n\nHere are the basic families:\n\n• Natural numbers count things: 1, 2, 3, 4, …\n• Whole numbers include 0: 0, 1, 2, 3, …\n• Integers extend to negatives: … −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, …\n• Rational numbers are anything that can be written as a fraction p/q where q ≠ 0. This includes all integers, all terminating decimals (0.25 = 1/4) and all recurring decimals (0.333… = 1/3).\n• Irrational numbers cannot be written as a fraction of two integers (examples: π, √2). Their decimal expansions neither terminate nor repeat.\n• Fractions express a part of a whole (numerator / denominator).\n• Decimals are fractions written in base-10 form.\n• Percentages are fractions with a denominator of 100.\n• Ratios compare two quantities of the same kind (a : b means a/b).\n\nThe mental model: think of a number line stretching from negative infinity to positive infinity. Every real number has exactly one position on this line, but it can be written in any of several notations. Converting between notations is a basic fluency skill — like translating between languages.\n\nYou should also know the meaning of these arithmetic terms:\n\n• Sum: result of addition.\n• Difference: result of subtraction.\n• Product: result of multiplication.\n• Quotient: result of division.\n• Remainder: what is left after dividing one integer by another.',

Once denominators are equal, add or subtract the numerators and keep the denominator unchanged.\n\nFractions are multiplied by multiplying numerators and denominators straight across: (a/b) × (c/d) = ac/bd. Always cancel common factors BEFORE multiplying — this keeps numbers small.\n\nFractions are divided by multiplying by the reciprocal: (a/b) ÷ (c/d) = (a/b) × (d/c).\n\nTo convert a fraction to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator. To convert a terminating decimal to a fraction, write it over the appropriate power of 10 (0.25 = 25/100) and reduce. To convert a recurring decimal, identify the repeating block and place it over 9, 99 or 999 (one 9 per repeating digit).\n\nTo convert a percentage to a decimal, divide by 100.

So 25% of a number means 25 out of every 100, which is 0.25 of that number.\n\nThe most powerful habit for percentages is the multiplier mindset:\n\n• A 20% increase means multiplying by 1.20.\n• A 20% decrease means multiplying by 0.80.\n• A 50% increase means multiplying by 1.50.\n• A 7% decrease means multiplying by 0.93.\n\nThis way of thinking makes successive changes easy and prevents the most common mistake — adding percentage changes together as if they were the same as numerical changes.\n\nA percentage is always measured against a base. The base must be identified before any calculation:\n\n• "A is what percentage of B?" has B as the base (denominator).\n• "Profit percentage" usually has cost price (CP) as the base.\n• "Discount percentage" has marked price (MP) as the base.\n• "Percentage change" has the original value as the base.\n\nThe fundamental operations:\n\n• To find x% of y: (x/100) × y.\n• To find what percentage A is of B: (A/B) × 100.\n• To increase y by x%: y × (1 + x/100).\n• To decrease y by x%: y × (1 − x/100).',

    'This chapter covers the most common HAT question families in commercial arithmetic: averages (including weighted averages and combined averages), profit and loss, discount and successive discounts, and the two kinds of interest — simple and compound. Each family has a clear conceptual backbone, and once you see it, the questions become routine. The chapter builds on Q1: percentages → profit/loss percentages, ratio-units → weighted averages, multipliers → compound interest.

If you know the average and the count, you know the total. If you know the total, you can find any individual value or any new average after changes.\n\nNew averages after adding or removing a value follow directly from this:\n\n• Add a value x to n observations with average A → new total = nA + x, new count = n + 1, new average = (nA + x) / (n + 1).\n• Remove a value x from n observations with average A → new total = nA − x, new count = n − 1, new average = (nA − x) / (n − 1).\n• Replace a value x with y → new total = nA − x + y, average stays over n.\n\nA useful observation: adding the same constant to every value increases the average by that constant.

    'Algebra is the language of HAT quantitative reasoning. Every word problem is translated into algebraic form before being solved, and a large fraction of questions test your fluency with equations, identities, polynomials and exponents. This chapter builds that fluency systematically. The chapter progresses from expression handling → linear equations → simultaneous equations → quadratics → higher-degree polynomials (especially cubics with parameters) → factorization → exponents → inequalities → word-problem translation. Each subtopic uses the algebra from the previous one. Particular attention is given to Vieta’s formulas for cubics that contain a parameter k — a pattern that appears frequently in recent HAT papers.',

  title: 'Geometry: Angles, Triangles, Circles, Areas, Volumes, Scaling & Coordinate Basics',

  definition:
    'Geometry for HAT is not about memorising every theorem. It is about recognising the shape, identifying what is being asked (length, angle, area, surface area or volume), and applying the right formula fluently. This chapter organises geometry into clear, recognisable families: lines and angles → triangles → similar triangles → quadrilaterals and polygons → circles → 3D solids → scaling → coordinate basics. Each subtopic builds on the previous one, and most questions reduce to a single formula once you classify the shape correctly. By the end of the chapter, you should be able to look at any HAT geometry question and immediately identify which formula applies.',

  definition:
    'This chapter covers the number-based reasoning at the heart of HAT: factors, multiples, primes, divisibility, HCF and LCM, remainders, arithmetic and geometric progressions, and pattern recognition. The key skill is to recognise STRUCTURE, not just compute. The chapter progresses from basic number types → divisibility → HCF/LCM → remainders → AP → GP → other sequence patterns → method selection, so each subtopic builds on the previous one.',

Every integer > 1 has a UNIQUE prime factorization (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic).\n\nProcess for prime factorization:\n1. Start with the smallest prime (2).\n2. Divide by 2 as many times as possible.\n3. Move to the next prime (3) and repeat.\n4.

To find LCM given HCF and product: LCM = product / HCF.\n\nIMPORTANT: This identity holds only for TWO positive integers.

  definition:
    'This chapter brings together the topics where data is summarised or predicted: probability rules, central tendency, weighted means, combinations and permutations, set counting, and reading tables and charts. The questions are rarely about heavy computation — they are about identifying what the data is saying and choosing the correct counting or probability model. The chapter progresses from basic probability → complements and independence → conditional probability → measures of central tendency → permutations & combinations → sets & Venn diagrams → data interpretation → method selection.',

  title: 'Applied Word Problems: Ages, Mixtures, Partnership, Clocks',

  definition:
    'Applied problems hide the math inside ordinary language. The skill is to translate each English sentence into a clear equation, ratio or relationship BEFORE computing anything. Most HAT applied questions fall into four families: (1) ages, where differences stay constant over time; (2) mixtures, where you combine ingredients at different prices or concentrations; (3) partnership, where profit splits in proportion to capital multiplied by time; and (4) clocks, where you track the relative motion of two hands. Master the translation — the arithmetic that follows is almost always a one-step linear equation or simple ratio.',

Let x be one person’s present age and express every other age relative to that anchor using the same time direction.\n\nTranslation rules:\n- “A is 5 years older than B” → A = B + 5 (relationship at the same time).\n- “x years ago” → subtract x from present.\n- “x years hence / from now / later” → add x to present.\n- “At age y” → set the relevant expression equal to y.\n- “A will be twice as old as B was 4 years ago” → (A + t₁) = 2 × (B − t₂) for appropriate t₁, t₂.\n\nTwo key ideas:\n1. Constant differences: If A is 8 years older than B today, A is still 8 years older than B 20 years from now and 20 years ago. Differences never change.\n2. Ratio changes with time: If A is twice as old as B today, that ratio will NOT hold 5 years from now. Treat “ratio statements” as snapshot equations, not permanent truths.\n\nStandard setup: Let the youngest person’s present age be x. Express every other age as x plus/minus a constant.

  title: 'HAT Quantitative Strategy: Question Recognition, Estimation & Error Analysis',

  definition:
    'Knowing the math is necessary but not sufficient. To perform well on HAT quantitative reasoning you need a strategy layer: how to recognise question types quickly (so you can pick the right method in seconds), how to use estimation and option elimination to cut down choices before computing, how to substitute answer choices when algebra is slow, and how to analyse mistakes so you do not repeat them. This chapter teaches the meta-skills that tie Q1–Q8 together.',

A student who works strictly in order can spend ten minutes on the first few hard questions and then panic-skip easy marks later.\n\nThe first-pass protocol:\n1. Scan all questions in 60–90 seconds. Mark each as EASY (solvable in under 1 minute), MEDIUM (1–2 minutes) or HARD (3+ minutes).\n2. Solve all EASY questions first and lock them in.\n3. Then solve MEDIUM questions in any order.\n4. Reserve HARD questions for last — these are where skipping is most often the right move.\n5. Use the last 3–5 minutes for a sweep of any unanswered or unsure questions; guess rather than leave blank (most HAT quantitative sections have no negative marking).\n\nTime budget: aim for 1.0–1.5 minutes average per question. If a question has consumed 2.5 minutes without a clear path, mark it and move on.
