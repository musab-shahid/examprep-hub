  title: 'Seating & Arrangement Puzzles',

  definition:
    'Seating and arrangement puzzles ask you to place people (or objects) in a row, circle, parallel rows, or on floors/shelves according to given clues. This is the single highest-frequency family in HAT Analytical Reasoning — roughly 25–30 % of the questions. The defining habit is: ALWAYS DRAW. A correct mental-only solution is rare and under time pressure is dangerous. This chapter trains you to translate each clue into a placement, eliminate impossible options quickly, and recognise when a question cannot be answered uniquely.',

      title: 'Linear (Row) Seating',
      summary: 'Placing people in a straight row facing one direction.',
      explanation:
        'In a linear row facing NORTH, position 1 is on the left of the diagram and position n is on the right. Left and right are measured from each person’s OWN perspective when the question uses phrases such as “to the immediate left of X”. When the question uses purely positional language (“third from the left”, “at the right end”), it refers to the diagram.\n\nDrawing convention: Draw a horizontal line of n boxes. Number them 1 to n from left to right (north-facing default).\n\nFor a row facing SOUTH the diagram is still drawn left-to-right, but each person’s left/right is reversed relative to the diagram. HAT almost always defaults to the observer’s (diagram) perspective unless the question explicitly says “from X’s point of view”.\n\nClue types and translations:\n1. Definite position: “A is at the left end” → A = position 1. “P sits third from the right” → P = n − 2.\n2. Relative position: “B is second to the right of A” → B = A + 2 (diagram right if north-facing).\n3. Immediate neighbour: “E sits immediately to the left of F” → E and F consecutive, E before F in diagram order (north-facing).\n4. Between: “G sits between H and I” → G is somewhere between H and I in the row (not necessarily adjacent unless the word “immediately” appears).\n5. Negative clues: “A is not adjacent to B” → they are not consecutive.\n\nSolve order:\n1. Place DEFINITE clues first.\n2. Place RELATIVE clues next.\n3. Apply NEGATIVE clues last.\n\nMulti-row linear puzzles (two rows of equal length facing the same direction) are solved exactly the same way per row; treat each row independently unless cross-row clues exist.',

  definition:
    'Blood-relation questions ask how two people are related, sometimes through a chain of statements and sometimes through a person pointing at a photograph. The skill is to draw a family tree with each generation on its own horizontal line, and to expand pointing phrases word-by-word from the INSIDE OUT. Gender, when explicitly stated, often eliminates two of four options immediately.

  title: 'Syllogisms: Venn Diagrams and Logical Conclusions',

  definition:
    'A syllogism has two or three statements (using All / Some / No / Some not) and asks which conclusions follow. The reliable HAT method is Venn diagrams: draw every diagram permitted by the statements, and a conclusion “follows” only if it is true in EVERY valid diagram. A single counter-diagram is enough to reject a conclusion. This chapter builds on A2’s “diagram-as-external-memory” habit — instead of placing people in time (generations) or space (seating), you place them in set membership. Master the four basic moves and the universal “follows = true in every diagram” rule and you can solve any HAT syllogism.',

  title: 'Critical Reasoning: Arguments, Assumptions, Strengtheners & Weakeners',

  definition:
    'Critical reasoning presents a short argument and asks about its strength. The argument has a CONCLUSION (the claim), EVIDENCE (the support), and often a hidden ASSUMPTION (the bridge). The main question types are assumption, strengthen, weaken, conclusion / must-be-true, and course-of-action. The discipline is: identify the conclusion FIRST (10 seconds), then locate the gap between evidence and claim. That gap is usually what the question targets. This chapter is the one students find most difficult — the difficulty lies in execution (avoiding traps), not in the concepts. Master the five question types and the six weakener patterns and the chapter becomes manageable.',

EVIDENCE — the facts, data, examples or reasons offered in support.\n3. ASSUMPTION — the unstated premise that connects evidence to conclusion (the “glue”).\n\nConclusion markers: therefore, thus, hence, so, consequently, this proves / shows that, we can conclude, clearly.\nEvidence markers: because, since, for example, studies show, data indicate, according to.\n\n5-step protocol for any CR question:\n1. Read the passage once (≈ 30 s) without trying to solve.\n2. Identify the conclusion (≈ 5 s) and mark it.\n3. Identify the evidence (≈ 5 s).\n4. Locate the gap (≈ 10 s) — what must be true for the evidence to support the conclusion?\n5. Read the question and apply the relevant strategy.\n\nThe “gap is the question” principle:\n- Assumption → fill the gap.\n- Strengthen → close or support one side of the gap.\n- Weaken → widen the gap or offer an alternative explanation.\n- Conclusion / must-be-true → derive a statement the passage actually supports.\n\nWhy conclusion-first matters: if you do not know what the argument is trying to prove, you cannot evaluate it.',

  definition:
    'Series, coding and pattern questions test fluency with numbers, letters and rules. They reward practice more than pure logic: each sub-type has a small library of standard patterns. Check the common patterns first (constant difference, increasing difference, multiplication, squares, cubes, primes) and invent an exotic rule only when the common ones fail. Letter problems become easy once you write the alphabet positions once and reuse them. This chapter continues the “translate each statement” habit — now translating numerical or alphabetic sequences into their underlying rules.',

  definition:
    'These questions ask who to include in a team or committee, or which person gets which task or slot. The discipline is to list every constraint first, apply hard constraints (must / cannot / exactly k) before soft ones, and use a grid for assignment problems. With n ≤ 6, systematic enumeration beats algebra. This chapter continues the “always draw” habit of A1–A6 — the diagram is now a people-versus-slots grid. By the end of A7 the diagram-as-external-memory habit reaches its fullest expression.',

Solving seating without a diagram (the #1 seating error).\n2. Confusing left/right orientation (circular facing centre vs outside, parallel rows).\n3. Forcing a unique answer when clues leave two possibilities.\n\n**Blood Relations (A2)**:\n4. Decoding pointing phrases outside-in instead of inside-out.\n5. Confusing "son of uncle" (cousin) with "son of brother" (nephew).\n6. Off-by-one generation errors (calling a cousin an uncle).\n\n**Syllogisms (A3)**:\n7. Assuming the reverse of "All A are B" (the #1 syllogism trap).\n8. Saying "follows" when a single counter-diagram exists.\n9. Confusing "possibility" with "definite" questions (opposites).\n\n**Critical Reasoning (A4)**:\n10. Skipping conclusion identification (the #1 CR error).\n11. Missing self-selection or reverse-causation weakeners.\n12. Confusing "must be true" with "could be true" (opposite questions).\n\n**Series/Coding (A5)**:\n13. Missing an interleaved dual series (20% of HAT series).\n14. Forgetting reverse-alphabet positions (A=26, Z=1).\n15. For digit coding: assigning same digit to different letters.\n\n**Directions/Ranking (A6)**:\n16. Using Top + Bottom = Total (forgetting the −1 — the #1 ranking error).\n17. Losing facing direction after multiple turns.\n18. For "people between", using |A − B| instead of |A − B| − 1.\n\n**Grouping (A7)**:\n19. Ignoring one negative constraint.\n20. Mixing "at least" with "exactly".\n\n**Strategy (A8)**:\n21. Doing questions in paper order instead of difficulty order.\n22. Spending 5+ minutes on one heavy question and missing easy marks.\n23. Cramming new topics the night before.\n\n**Cross-cutting**:\n24. Forgetting to write alphabet positions for letter series.\n25. Not recognising the question family in 10 seconds (the meta-skill).',

      summary: 'The pre-submit checklist for analytical questions.',
      explanation:
        'Before submitting each question, run this 5-question checklist in 10-15 seconds. It catches 30%+ of all errors.\n\n**The checklist**:\n\n1. **Did I draw the diagram?** (For seating, blood, syllogism, direction, ranking, assignment.)\n2. **Did I check every constraint?** (For grouping/selection — every candidate vs every constraint.)\n3. **Is the conclusion supported?** (For syllogism — true in EVERY diagram. For CR — supported by passage.)\n4. **Is the answer addressing the question?** (For CR — strengthen closes the gap, weakener widens it.)\n5. **Did I use the right end?** (For ranking — top vs bottom confusion. For interchange — opposite ends.)\n\nIf any check fails, re-examine the question. Most errors surface here.',
      examples: [
        {
          problem: 'You solved a syllogism and marked "follows". Before submitting, what should you check?',
          solution: '**CHECK 1**: Did I draw at least one candidate diagram? If no → redraw.\n\n**CHECK 2**: Did I try a COUNTER-DIAGRAM (one that violates the conclusion)? If I COULD draw one → does NOT follow. If I COULDN\'T → follows.\n\n**CHECK 3**: Did I check the conclusion in EVERY diagram I drew? If yes → confident. If no → re-check.\n\n**APPLY**: The "counter-diagram test" is the single most reliable check for syllogisms. If you can draw a counter-diagram, the conclusion does NOT follow.'

"Must be true" requires it in EVERY scenario. If you can construct a scenario where it\'s false → wrong.\n\n**CHECK 3**: Is the option over-strong? "All", "never", "must", "always" → often wrong when passage is moderate.\n\n**APPLY**: The "every scenario" test is the key for "must be true". If the option could fail in any scenario consistent with the passage, it\'s not a must.'
